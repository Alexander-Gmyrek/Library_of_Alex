## Quick notes

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to package applications into nice little boxes. This includes everything they need to function, aka their ‚Äúdependencies‚Äù.  This box is called a ‚ÄúContainer‚Äù and is the core piece in the ‚ÄúContainerization‚Äù process. This box can be accessed via "ports" that allow you to send info in or out, along with a few other access methods. These boxes can be run on any machine with Docker installed regardless of operating system or other device specific software configurations, assuming it meets the necessary hardware requirements. This means that you can give the box to anyone with Docker and they will be able to use it without needing anything else. 

## Docker Containers

- **Image:** A static executable snapshot of the application that contains everything need to run the application. This includes the application‚Äôs code, libraries, runtime, environment variables, and configuration files. It is a static definition of  what a container should contain and how it should behave.
- **Dockerfile:** a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker Image. Each instruction in the the Dockerfile corresponds to a layer in the container image. The Dockerfile specifies the base image, environment setup, dependencies, configuration files, and the command to run the application.
- **Layers:** Read only files that represent filesystem changes. Each layer in the container image corresponds to the instruction in the Dockerfile. Layers are stacked on top of each other to form the final container image. The Union File System or UFS combines these layers, making them appear as a single coherent filesystem.
- **Container Runtime:** the software that runs and manages containers on a host system. Docker Engine is the most common container runtime. The runtime is responsible for creating, starting, stopping, and managing containers.
- **Namespaces:** Provide isolation for running containers. They ensure that each container has its own isolated environment, including process IDs (PID namespace), network interfaces (net namespace), filesystem (mount namespace), and other system resources.
- **Cgroups:** Aka Control Groups, are a Linux kernel feature used to limit prioritize and account for the resource usage, i.e. CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc. of a  container. Cgroups ensure that containers do not exceed their allocated resources and help in resource management.
- **Volumes:** used to persist data generated and used by Docker containers. They provide a way to share data between the host system and containers, or between multiple containers.
- **Docker Networks:** Docker provides networking capabilities to allow containers to communicate with each other and with external systems. Docker networks can be configured to use different drivers (e.g., bridge, host, overlay) to control how containers are connected and isolated.
- **Configuration:** Containers can be configured using environment variables, configuration files, and Docker secrets. These mechanisms allow for the dynamic configuration of containers without modifying the container image.
- **Secrets:** Provide a secure way to store sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and certificates.

## Necessary files

- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- requirements.txt

## To Compile

- docker-compose up --build
- If someone is using your ports try ‚Äúnetstat -ano | findstr :<port number>‚Äù then ‚Äútaskkill /PID <pid_number> /F‚Äù

## **Set Up Docker**

- Install Docker.
- Write a Dockerfile.
- Build the Docker image.
- Run the Docker container.
- Use Docker Compose for multi-container setups.

## Access methods

*More info on these please.

- **Ports:** Used for network communication
- **Volumes:** Used to persist data and share it between the container and the host.
- **Environment Variables:** Used to pass configuration data to containers.
- **Docker Networks:** Facilitate communication between multiple containers.

## Definitions

- **Containerization:** Making standardized ‚Äúboxes‚Äù or ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù that can be used anywhere and run without additional set up or dependencies. It can be seen as an application level of abstraction and is an integral part of the engineering design process. Allowing easy deployment and division of labor.
- **Dependencies:** External components an application requires to function. This includes Libraries, Frameworks, external services, configuration files, system dependencies, and packages.
- **Library:** Collections of prewritten code that a developer can use to optimize tasks
- **Framework:** A larger structure that provides a foundation on which to build programs. Selecting the proper framework/s is an important part of the project design process as the often dictate the architecture, format, and functionality of an application.
- **External Service:** Services that an application relies on, such as databases, authentication services, or APIs from third parties.
- **Configuration File:** Files that define how a software interacts with it‚Äôs environment, such as environment settings, database connection strings, API keys, and more.
- **System Dependencies:** Operating system-level components that the application needs to run, such as specific versions of runtime environments, system utilities, or other system software.
- **Packages:** Bundled sets of code and recourses distributed through a package manager.
- **Package Manager:** a language specific application that allows you to download, update, and delete packages in your environment, usually accessed through the command line.
- **Application:** A ready made program or collection of program designed to help a user complete a task or group of tasks. If you imagine programs as kitchen tools like a knife, whisk, or pot, used to complete one specific task or part of a task like chop vegetables or whisk eggs, you can imagine an application like an appliance with many functions that helps you prepare an entire dish.
- **Program:** sets of instructions a computer can execute to preform a specific task. They are the fundamental building blocks of software. Programs are used to automate tasks. Programs are made up of executable instructions written in source code that are then compiled into machine code for the computer to execute or interpreted by the computer at run time.
- **Dockerfile:** A text file with instructions on how to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Image:** A snapshot of a container that includes everything needed to run an application.
- **Docker Container:** A running instance of a Docker image.
- **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **A:** a
